"The Qwen3 Embedding model series is the latest proprietary model of the "
"Qwen family, specifically designed for text embedding and ranking tasks. "
"Building upon the dense foundational models of the Qwen3 series, it "
"provides a comprehensive range of text embeddings and reranking models in"
" various sizes (0.6B, 4B, and 8B). This guide describes how to run the "
"model with vLLM Ascend. Note that only 0.9.2rc1 and higher versions of "
"vLLM Ascend support the model."
