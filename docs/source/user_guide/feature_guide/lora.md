# LoRA Adapters Guide

Like vLLM, vllm-ascend supports LoRA as well. The usage and more details can be found in [vLLM official document](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/features/lora.html).

You can refer to [Supported Models](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html#list-of-text-only-language-models) to find which models support LoRA in vLLM.

You can run LoRA with ACLGraph mode now. Please refer to [Graph Mode Guide](./graph_mode.md) for a better LoRA performance.
