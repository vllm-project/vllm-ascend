# Feature Support

The feature support principle of vLLM Ascend is: **aligned with the vLLM**. We are also actively collaborating with the community to accelerate support.

You can check the [support status of vLLM V1 Engine][v1_user_guide]. Below is the feature support status of vLLM Ascend:

| Feature                       |      Status    | Next Step                                                              |
