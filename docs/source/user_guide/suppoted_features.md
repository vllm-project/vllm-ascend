# Feature Support

The feature support principle of vLLM Ascend is: **aligned with the vLLM**. We are also actively collaborating with the community to accelerate support.

vLLM Ascend offers the overall functional support of the most features in vLLM, and the usage keep the same with vLLM except for some limits.

```{note}
MindIE Turbo is an optional performace optimization plugin. Find more information about the feature support of MindIE Turbo here(UPDATE_ME_AS_A_LINK).
