# Release note

## v0.8.4rc2

This is the second release candidate of v0.8.4 for vllm-ascend. Please follow the [official doc](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/) to start the journey. Some experimental features are included in this version, such as W8A8 quantization and EP/DP support. We'll make them stable enough in the next release.

### Highlights
- Qwen3 and Qwen3MOE is supported now. Please follow the [official doc](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/single_npu.html) to run the quick demo. [#709](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/709)
- Ascend W8A8 quantization method is supported now. Please take the [official doc](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/multi_npu_quantization.html) for example. Any [feedback](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/issues/619) is welcome. [#580](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/580)

## v0.8.4rc1

This is the first release candidate of v0.8.4 for vllm-ascend. Please follow the [official doc](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/) to start the journey. From this version, vllm-ascend will follow the newest version of vllm and release every two weeks. For example, if vllm releases v0.8.5 in the next two weeks, vllm-ascend will release v0.8.5rc1 instead of v0.8.4rc2. Please find the detail from the [official documentation](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/versioning_policy.html#release-window).

### Highlights

- vLLM V1 engine experimental support is included in this version. You can visit [official guide](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/getting_started/v1_user_guide.html) to get more detail. By default, vLLM will fallback to V0 if V1 doesn't work, please set `VLLM_USE_V1=1` environment if you want to use V1 forcely.

- Qwen, Llama series and other popular models are also supported, you can see more details in [here](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/supported_models.html).

### Core

- Added the Ascend quantization config option, the implementation will coming soon. [#7](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/7) [#73](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/73)

- There are logs like `No platform detected, vLLM is running on UnspecifiedPlatform` or `Failed to import from vllm._C with ModuleNotFoundError("No module named 'vllm._C'")` shown when running vllm-ascend. It actually doesn't affect any functionality and performance. You can just ignore it. And it has been fixed in this [PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12432) which will be included in v0.7.3 soon.
- There are logs like `# CPU blocks: 35064, # CPU blocks: 2730` shown when running vllm-ascend which should be `# NPU blocks:` . It actually doesn't affect any functionality and performance. You can just ignore it. And it has been fixed in this [PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/13378) which will be included in v0.7.3 soon.
