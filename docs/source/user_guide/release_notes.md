# Release note

## v0.9.0rc1 - 2025.06.07

This is the 1st release candidate of v0.9.0 for vllm-ascend. Please follow the [official doc](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/) to start the journey. From this release, V1 Engine is recommended to use. The code of V0 Engine is frozen and will not be maintained any more. Please set environment `VLLM_USE_V1=1` to enable V1 Engine.

### Highlights

- DeepSeek works with graph mode now. Follow the [official doc](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/graph_mode.html) to take a try. [#789](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-ascend/pull/789)
- Qwen series models works with graph mode now. It works by default with V1 Engine. Please note that in this release, only Qwen series models are well tested with graph mode. We'll make it stable and generalize in the next release. If you hit any issues, please feel free to open an issue on GitHub and fallback to eager mode temporarily by set `enforce_eager=True` when initializing the model.

### Known issues

- This release relies on an unreleased torch_npu version. It has been installed within official container image already. Please [install](https://vllm-ascend.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1rc1/installation.html) it manually if you are using non-container environment.
- There are logs like `No platform detected, vLLM is running on UnspecifiedPlatform` or `Failed to import from vllm._C with ModuleNotFoundError("No module named 'vllm._C'")` shown when running vllm-ascend. It actually doesn't affect any functionality and performance. You can just ignore it. And it has been fixed in this [PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/12432) which will be included in v0.7.3 soon.
- There are logs like `# CPU blocks: 35064, # CPU blocks: 2730` shown when running vllm-ascend which should be `# NPU blocks:` . It actually doesn't affect any functionality and performance. You can just ignore it. And it has been fixed in this [PR](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/13378) which will be included in v0.7.3 soon.
