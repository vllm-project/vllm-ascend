Description:

    Update and clarify the installation workflow for new users of ops‑math, especially in Ascend‑NPU environments.

    Add detailed steps for environment setup (dependencies, CANN/Ascend toolkit, Python paths), so users don’t keep “stumbling on” path/config issues.

    Add example usage snippet for PyTorch (or similar) so users can verify the module is imported correctly.

    No changes to the core C++/算子 logic — purely documentation enhancements.

Changes:

    Expanded the “Getting Started” section in README.md to break down:

        Clone repo, select branch

        Create build folder, run cmake and ninja appropriately

        Ensure correct Ascend environment (source /usr/local/Ascend/set_env.sh)

        Ensure Python path includes generated module or wheel install.

    Added a “Troubleshooting” subsection for common issues (e.g., ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ops_math').

    Added an example Python snippet using PyTorch to validate correct import and operator call (add).

    Cleaned up wording, fixed typos and standardised command formatting.

Rationale:

    Many users encounter issues such as “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ops_math'” or “missing CMakeCache.txt” which stem from unclear initial setup instructions.

    By improving the documentation, we reduce onboarding friction and improve the developer experience.

    Focusing purely on documentation keeps the scope safe and review‑friendly.

Test Plan:

    Not applicable (no code change).

    Verified that following the updated installation steps allows successful import of ops_math in a clean Ascend environment.

Impact:

    Low risk — only docs change.

    Improves clarity and decreases user support load.
