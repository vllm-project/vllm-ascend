"""
Register linear layers into a shared storage series.

In a parallel group, each device stores a distinct, non-overlapping subset of layers from the series. All layers in a series must have the same structure (are isomorphic). The weight matrix for the i-th layer is stored on device (i % n), where n is the number of devices.

After loading the model, you must call `post_process_after_loading_for_shared_weight_series(layer)` on any layer of this series to complete the initialization.

During execution, each time a new layer is reached, you must call `reach_layer_for_shared_weight_series(layer)` for that layer to prefetch the weights. The argument `prefetch_step` is a non-negative integer k that manages asynchronous weight prefetching. Each call to `reach_layer_for_shared_weight_series(current_layer)` method will trigger an asynchronous prefetch for the weights of the k-th subsequent layer after `current_layer` within the series.

Note: The layers are managed as a circular buffer. The index of the layer to prefetch is determined by the formula:
- start_layer is the index of the first layer in the series (inclusive).
- end_layer is the index of the last layer in the series (exclusive). Thus, the series includes all layers with indices in the range [start_layer, end_layer).
- total_layers = end_layer - start_layer
- prefetch_layer_idx = (layer_idx + prefetch_step) % total_layers + start_layer

To hold the weights for the current layer and the k prefetched layers, a pool of (k + 1) shared tensor buffers will be created for this series.

Arguments:
    series_name: This name identifies which series this layer belongs to.
    group: The group coordinator for handling asynchronous communications. It is recommended to create a new group coordinator for each new series.
    layer: The linear layer object to register.
    prefetch_step: An integer that manages asynchronous weight prefetching. Setting it to 0 or 1 can cover most cases.
