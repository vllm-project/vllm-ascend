# What's Patched and how it works:
# ** File: platform/patch_0_8_4/patch_config.py**
#   1. `vllm.config.ModelConfig.__init__()`
#    Why:
#       It is hard coded for sleep mode to support cuda platform only
#    Howï¼š
#       Using a new method to check if sleep mode is available
#    Related PR (if no, explain why): 1. refused by vllm. 2. vllm doesn't support 3. prepare to submit....
#       https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/16562
#    Future Plan:
#       This patch is only used for 084 and can't be revert. just keep as it is.
