# Interface mapping generator accuracy log

This log records why each generator iteration changed, the boundary case it
handles, and the evidence used to decide whether a result is a source risk or a
generator problem.

## v0.4.0 - classify every non-verified candidate

- Baseline commit: `7954d7c2ab35959c450b48aa52dae5401a8d4b4f`.
- Source pair: vLLM `88402a41c4ab272ebbbd33f4a77fbbac0431cbb9`
  and vllm-ascend `81d3450128528be2c343232fcc28220814a15fd6`.
- Before: 959 verified relations and 40 records all labelled `unresolved`.
- Problem: real upstream removals, expected missing-member injection, inactive
  guards, incomplete MRO, field writes, and parser limitations were mixed
  together. A real missing upstream target was absent from the main mapping
  output.
- Change: schema v3 includes candidate findings in the main JSONL and gives
  every finding a `status`, `reason_code`, and `generator_issue` flag.
- After the fixed-source run: 959 verified relations plus 40 findings: 14
  upstream risks, 2 expected injections, 1 inactive branch, and 23 reviews.
  Eighteen findings are still marked as generator work for later iterations.
- Generic rules added in this iteration:
  - a missing inherited base is an upstream risk;
  - a missing patch member under `not hasattr(...)` is an expected injection;
  - a missing patch member under `hasattr(...)` is an inactive branch;
  - a missing member on a known upstream owner is an upstream risk;
  - an unknown patch owner remains a generator review instead of being guessed.
- Reason: later parser fixes must reclassify only genuine generator gaps. They
  must not make real upstream incompatibilities disappear merely to reduce the
  unresolved count.

## v0.3.0 - rollback baseline

- Commit: `7954d7c2ab35959c450b48aa52dae5401a8d4b4f`.
- Added the AST-only patch, inheritance, and verified-override generator.
- Tests: 12 passed; Ruff passed.
- Full fixed-source result: 959 relations and 40 unresolved records; output
  SHA-256 `52b5064257a30dfbf70a47e80061aa2319c60ee2c5e468051d710ce19461952e`.
